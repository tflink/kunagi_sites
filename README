This repository contains the velocity templates, css and images to be used with
Kunagi (http://kunagi.org) for several projects.

The templates for these projects are stored one per branch to make it easier
to deploy on systems.

These were created by borrowing very heavily from Kunagi's own templates that
are licensed as AGPLv3. Those templates are copyright 2008-2011 Witoslaw Koczewski,
Artjom Kochtchi, Arne Moehle, Fabian Hager, Kacper Grubalski.

The content in this repository is mostly licenced as AGPLv3 with the exception
of the images in html/img which are all licensed under the Creative Commons licence
CC-BY-SA 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).
