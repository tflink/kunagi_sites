                    The <strong>Product Backlog</strong> is a prioritized list of desired product features in
                    form of User Stories. 
                </p><p>
                    While the Product Owner keeps the backlog up to date, the Team estimates the effort
                    necessary to implement those Stories (using <strong>Planning Poker</strong>). Based on this
                    estimation and the teams performance in prior Sprints, it is possible to <strong>project the
                    scope</strong>of future Sprints.

                    clue of the current progress as they are moved from left (to do) to right (done).
